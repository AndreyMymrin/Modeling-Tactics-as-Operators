# Compute
device: cpu                                   # common sense (CPU default)

# Model

cap_per_tactic: 5000                          # original params (paper: cap K=5000 steps per tactic)

# Training

batch_size: 4096                              # common sense (not in paper; speed/stability)
neg_k: 15                                     # original params (paper: 15 negatives per positive for ∆-SGNS)
